## Summary

Report unused npm packages in nodejs project.

## Installation

    [sudo] npm install -g unused-deps

##Â Usage

Go to your project's root (where `package.json` is stored) and run:

    unused-deps

You should see similar output:

    npm uninstall --save     ansi
    npm uninstall --save     debug
    npm uninstall --save     ejs
    npm uninstall --save-dev faker2
    npm uninstall --save-dev hotnode

An empty result means there are no unused npms in `package.json`.

If you want to skip reporting of unused npms you can list them in a comment
for example in `Gruntfile.coffee` (or `.js`):

    # Skip unused-deps:
    #
    # require 'coffee-script'
    # require 'grunt'
    # require 'grunt-cli'
    # require 'mocha-jenkins-reporter'
    # require 'codo'
    # require 'coffeelint'
    # require 'hotnode'
    # require 'mocha'
